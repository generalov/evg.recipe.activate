Description
===========

This buildout recipe can be used to create an activation script for zc.buildout
environment.

You can see an example of how to use the recipe below::

  [buildout]
  parts = activate

  [activate]
  recipe = evg.recipe.activate


Run buildout. Then on Posix systems you can do::
    
    $ source bin/activate

This will change your ``$PATH`` to point to the virtualenv ``bin/`` directory.
You have to use ``source`` because it changes the environment in-place. After
activating an environment you can use the function ``deactivate`` to undo the
changes::

    (buildout) $ deactivate

The ``activate`` script will also modify your shell prompt to indicate which
environment is currently active. 
    

Supported options
=================

The recipe supports the following options:

activate
  The name of the script created in the bin folder. This script is the
  equivalent of the ``activate`` virtualenv. It defaults to ``activate``.

deactivate
  The name of the function to deactivate environment. It defaults to
  ``deactivate``.
